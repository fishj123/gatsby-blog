Create React App is compatible with older browsers including Internet Explorer, but not out-of-the-box. There is a minor amount of setup required to get things working.
<br/>
<br/>
Let's start with the packages that you will need to install to get things running.

```terminal
npm install core-js
npm install react-app-polyfill
```

With these installed the next step is to make sure your targeted browser list is correct for your needs. This can be found in the package.json file that is generated by Create React App.

```json
"browserslist": {
    "production": [
      ">0.2%",
      "not dead",
      "not op_mini all"
    ],
    "development": [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version",
      "last 1 ie version"
    ]
  }
```

This is the setup that I use - I want to be able to see how things are working in IE11 when I'm developing, so I add 'last 1 ie version' to the development array - everything else is out-of-the-box setup.
<br/>
<br/>
The next step is to import the polyfills you need in your index.js file.

```javascript
// These must be the first 2 lines in src/index.js
import "react-app-polyfill/ie9"
import "react-app-polyfill/stable"
```

Next open up Index.html which is found in the public folder. Add this meta tag near the top of your head - this step isn't always necessary but I like to add it in for safe measure.

```html
<head>
  ...
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=11" />
  ...
</head>
```

The final step is to incorporate core-js which you installed earlier. Create a file at the root of your project named 'polyfills.js' and add the following:

```javascript
// polyfills.js
import "react-app-polyfill/ie11" // internet explorer 11 polyfills
import "core-js/features/array/find" // array.prototype.find polyfill
import "core-js/features/array/includes" // array.prototype.includes polyfill
import "core-js/features/number/is-nan" // isNan polyfill
```

In the above code I have imported the features that I am using (find/includes/isNan) - you should import any additional features that you are using. You can find a list of available imports in the core-js docs.
<br/>
<br/>
And now all you need to do is import your polyfills.js file into the top of your index.js file, which should look like this:

```javascript
// These must be the first 2 lines in src/index.js
import "react-app-polyfill/ie9"
import "react-app-polyfill/stable"

import "./polyfills" // new import we just added
```

That's it. If you are still having issues then try deleting your node_modules/.cache folder to force an update on your browser list targets.
