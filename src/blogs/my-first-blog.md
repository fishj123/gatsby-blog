Welcome to my first blog. 
<br><br>
I'll be using it as a place to blog about things I've learned whilst programming. This will be both a good way for me to solidify my knowledge of the topics I am learning as well as a place for others to learn from me. 
<br><br>
I created this blog as a way to learn Gatsby - the static site generator that is powering this blog. If you don't already know, Gatsby creates blazingly fast websites using React and GraphQL. Although I had worked with React before building this blog, I had never worked with GraphQL, so that was a big learning point for me. The true power of Gatsby comes from it's wide range of plugins. One such plugin that I used on this blog is gatsby-image which allows you to use GraphQL to put optimised images on the page. 
<br><br> 
If you'd like to checkout Gatsby for yourself then just head on over to their <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/ " target="_blank">website</a>. They have excellent documentation that is very beginner friendly. 

That's it for this blog. I'm going to try and commit myself to writing one article each week - mostly guides for beginners based on what I have learned. Stay tuned for the next one!
<br><br> 
Jack
